In this assignment you will implement a program that calculates the BLEU evaluation metric, as defined in Papineni, Roukos, Ward and Zhu (2002): Bleu: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation, ACL 2002. 

You will run the program on sets of candidate and reference translations, and calculate the BLEU score for each candidate. 

You will write a Python program which will take a two paths as parameters: the first parameter will be the path to the candidate translation (a single file), and the second parameter will be a path to the reference translations (either a single file, or a directory if there are multiple reference translations). The program will write an output file called bleu_out.txt which contains a single floating point number, representing the BLEU score of the candidate translation relative to the set of reference translations.
 > python calculatebleu.py /path/to/candidate /path/to/reference

The German, Greek and Portuguese reference translations above are excerpted from the common test set of the EUROPARL corpus; the candidate translations were obtained by taking the corresponding English sentences and running them through Google Translate. The English reference translations are from two alternative translations of the Passover Hagaddah; the candidate translation was obtained by running the original Hebrew text through Google translate.
